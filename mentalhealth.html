				<p class="general">Mental health is an often overlooked part of our overall health. It includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being, and it can be affected by a variety of factors throughout our lives such as life experiences and biological factors. For college students specifically, mental illness can greatly impact a person’s health and well-being. It can present numerous challenges in an already pressure-filled environment and is often stigmatized as well.
				<br><br>
				For college students, there are numerous resources available related to mental health both on and off campus.  By being aware of and taking advantage of these resources, we can better understand and recognize our needs as well as how to be mindful of our mental health overall.
				<br><br>
				Now, more than ever, it is crucial to be aware of the importance in taking care of our mental health, reaching out when we need it, and fighting the stigma against taking care of ourselves mentally as well as physically. By talking about mental health and the resources available, we can start to normalize taking care of this aspect of our health just as we would with any other aspect.</p>
